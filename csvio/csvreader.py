    This object represents a CSV file for reading.

    :param fieldnames:
        A list of strings representing the column headings for the CSV
        file.
        If this list is specified while initiating an Object of this class
        then it is used as the column headings. This is handy when the CSV
        to read does not have column headings.
        Otherwise this list is populated from the CSV that is set in the
        *filename* argument of this Class's constructor.
    :type fieldnames: optional

    :param fieldprocessor:
        An instance of the :py:class:`~csvio.processors.field_processor.FieldProcessor`
        object. The processor functions defined in the :py:class:`~csvio.processors.field_processor.FieldProcessor`
        object are applied to the rows in the CSV after they read.
    :type fieldprocessor: optional

    :param open_kwargs:
        A dictionary of key, value pairs that should be passed to the open
        method within this class.
    :type open_kwargs: optional

    :param csv_kwargs:
        A dictionary of key, value pairs that should be passed to the
        DictReader constructor within this class.
